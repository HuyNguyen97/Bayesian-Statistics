\subsection*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Don't look at the solution yet!} This is for your benefit.
\item This exercise must be submitted within 48 hours of the lecture in which it was given. 
\item As long as you do the exercise on time, you get full credit---your performance does not matter.
\item Without looking at the solution, take 5 minutes to try to solve the exercise.
\item Pre-assessment: Write down how correct you think your answer is, from 0 to 100\%.
\item Post-assessment: Now, study the solution and give yourself a ``grade'' from 0 to 100\%.
\item Submit your work on the course website, including the pre- and post- assessments.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercise}
Consider the following model:
\begin{align*}
    & \beta \sim \N(\mu_0,\sigma_0^2) \\
    & \sigma^2 \sim \InvGamma(a,b) \\
    & X_1,\ldots,X_n\iid \N(0,1) \\
    & Y_i|\beta,\sigma^2,x_{1:n}\,\sim\,\N(\beta x_i,\sigma^2) \text{ independently for } i=1,\ldots,n.
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw the (natural) directed graphical model.
    \item Draw the corresponding moral graph.
    \item 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Are $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$ independent?
        \item Are $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$ independent given $X_{1:n}$ and $Y_{1:n}$?
        \item Are $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ independent?
        \item Are $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ independent given $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}\addtocounter{enumi}{2}
\item It is important to note that the graphical model can tell you that two variables are conditionally independent, 
but cannot tell you that they are not conditional independent (i.e., it cannot tell you that they are conditionally dependent).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Yes, by construction. (Write down the joint pdf to convince yourself.)
    \item No, since, for example, $p(\beta|\sigma^2,x_{1:n},y_{1:n})$ depends on $\sigma^2$. (Derive this conditional distribution to convince yourself.)
    \item No, since, for example, the posterior predictive $p(y_2|y_1)$ depends on $y_1$. (We can tell that this will be the case since knowledge of $y_1$ gives us information about $\sigma^2$ --- e.g., a large value of $y_1$ indicates a large $\sigma$ --- which, in turn, gives us information about $y_2$.)
    \item Yes. In the moral graph, every path from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$ passes through $\beta$ or $\sigma^2$.
